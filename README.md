This program implements the LZ78 Lossless Compression Algorithm. This program builds with two main targets, one for compression and one for decompression. To create the executables, run the make file by using make clean then make all. The encode executable allows the user to compress data from an input into an output. The decode executable allows the user to decompress data from an input into an output. Running the executable "./encode" or "./decode" with the specifier -h gives the user a menu with all the available options.
